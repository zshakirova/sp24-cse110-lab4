# Part 1

## Question 1:
- Output: `values added: 20`

## Question 2:
- Output: `final result: 20`

## Question 3:
- Output: `values added: 20`

## Question 4:
- Output: Code returns an error because `result` is declared in the if block with `let`. We know that `let` has a block scope, meaning that it’s not accessible outside of that block.

## Question 5:
- Output: Code causes an error because at line 7 code attempts to reassign a new value to a const variable, which is not allowed. 

## Question 6:
- Output: This line could not be even reached because execution would stop on line 7 (because of trying reassigning a new value to a const variable). `result` is also not defined in the same block as what’s written on line 13.
